## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Software Engineer, Cloud Architect, and mentor who loves building robust, scalable, and secure platforms. I lead and architect full-stack solutions with an emphasis on:

- **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Azure, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions, CI/CD
- **Cybersecurity:** Secure-by-design practices
- **Clean Code:** Domain-driven design, clean architecture
- **Mentorship:** Coaching developers, engineering teams, startup founders, and tech leaders

I help companies—from startups to enterprises—build software that lasts. My focus: results, long-term value, and technical clarity. Whether hands-on, leading teams, or consulting, I bring energy, strategic vision, and a bias for action.
